SURVEY FORM MODEL

A survey is the process of collecting, analysing and interpreting data from many individuals. It aims to determine insights about a group of people. A survey goes much deeper than a questionnaire and often involves more than one form of data collection.
This is a simple survey form made using HTML,CSS and Javascript. It's database is stored onto google sheets.

Using HTML a welcome page is created which gives a brief itroduction about the survey form, and takes you to the survey form by clicking onto the start button.
A form model is created. Input fields for personal details(name,state,age etc.) are created, radio buttons are created for various questions and a textbox for the user to give suggestions. Then it is submitted by clicking on the submit button. JavaScript code is used to send the data to google sheets where it is then stored and maintained. After clicking submit an alert will be provided, which on clicking ok will redirect you to a 'Thank You' page.
Using CSS the Survey form is given more Character. Images, Font size, alignment, border, margin, GIF all are added so that it becomes more appealing.
